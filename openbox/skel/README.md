Hello
Thank you for trying d77void Openbox edition.

To run the installer just open a terminal and type:

```
sudo d77void-installer
```

Note: 
To maintain the configuration of the live iso, during install, choose local instead of network install.

During install, add your user to the storage group. That way udiskie will automount disks.


To install with Calamares:

```
su

calamares
```

# 1st run:

## d77-welcome

Don't forget to run the d77-welcome script; it will help you in several things; on first run after install I suggest 
the install of d77void repository files and I strongly advise you to remove calamares with the helper on d77-welcome.

## Conky

To tweak conky, edit .conkyrc; 

### Weather

No longer needed to update weather api; I changed the method to receive and parse weather info.

### Wifi

Probably you will need to change the wifi card device name to display properly the info.
Check wich device name this way:

```
ip a
```
The one with w??? is the correct name. Change it this way:

```
sed -i 's|wlp21s0|w???|g' .conkyrc
```

In case battery is not working properly, swap BAT0 to BAT1 this way; open a terminal and type:

```
sed -i 's|BAT0|BAT1|g' .conkyrc
```
