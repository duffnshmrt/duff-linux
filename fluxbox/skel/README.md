Hello
Thank you for trying d77void.

To run the installer just open a terminal and type:

```
sudo d77void-installer
```

Note: 
To maintain the configuration of the live iso, during install, choose local instead of network install.

During install, add your user to the storage group. That way udiskie will automount disks.

# NEWS

Now Calamares installer is available making the install process even simpler.

I would like to thank Calamares team, Kevin Figueroa (Cereus Linux) and johna1 (F-Void Linux) for all the work done and guidance.

I would like to express my gratitude and say a big thank you to Rúben Gomez (Youtube channel Ruben_&_Linux_:~) for all the encouragement.

To install with Calamares:

```
su

calamares
```

# 1st run:

## Conky

To tweak conky, edit .conkyrc; 

It is no longer needed an weathermap API to retrieve weather info; I changed the method.

Probably you will need to change the wifi card device name to display properly the info.
Check wich device name this way:

```
ip a
```
The one with w??? is the correct name. Change it this way:

```
sed -i 's|wlp21s0|w???|g' .conkyrc
```

In case battery is not working properly, swap BAT0 to BAT1 this way; open a terminal and type:

```
sed -i 's|BAT0|BAT1|' .conkyrc
```

## Fluxbox Variables
